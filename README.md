# PROJECT: LANDING PAGE
The goal of this project is to create a landing page according to a design specification and template provided by The Odin Project using HTML and CSS.

## Learning goal
- Understand the box model.
- Use flexbox to layout the page.

#### Reflection/Outcome
Instead of following the given example, I decided to create a landing page for a creative design company named "The Odin Creative". I maintain the font and the color palette given for the project. I write copies that are suitable for a creative design company and select images that will fit my concept.
